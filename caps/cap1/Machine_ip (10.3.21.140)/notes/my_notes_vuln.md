# Vulnerability notes
During the vulnerability assessment, it was discovered that the apache struts framework used in the web application server is an outdated version(2.2.8) which is vulnerable. FTP server is vulnerable to anonymous login. SSH is vulnerable to brute force. 

I try to exploit every port that is opened with metasploit which are all vulnerable. So I request to follow up the remediation summary for safety.
