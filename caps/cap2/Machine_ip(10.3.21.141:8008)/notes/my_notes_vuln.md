# Vulnerability notes
Under each website there are more than 30 plus vulnerabilities, but for now I can only check vulnerabilities on this machine . http://10.3.21.141:8008 and I got 3 vulnerabilities , they are ;
1. Cross-site scripting(xss)
2. Privilege escalation
3. Path traversal 

I was able to get those vulnerabilities as it was common and easy to crack. Those vulnerabilities can be also fixed and I have mentioned how in the report under remediation summary. All those approaches I mentioned were research based so it was the best approach to fix those vulnerabilities.
